      about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\nselected a target;\nrequested
      a scaffold targeting these compounds;\nOnce the compound was identified, the
      model attempted its synthesis.\n\nThey also discussed the risks, especially
      with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list
      of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out
      of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent
      attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were
      rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while
      2 were rejected based on prompt only.\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\nGenerative
      Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters,
      each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox
      environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra
      of human behavior for interactive applications.\nThe design of generative agents
      combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents
      to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other
      agents.\n\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that
      records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019 experience in natural language.\n\nEach
      element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\n- Inter-agent
      communication can trigger new natural language statements.\n\n\nRetrieval model:
      surfaces the context to inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance,
      recency and importance.\n\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\nImportance:
      distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\nRelevance: based on
      how related it is to the current situation / query.\n\n\nReflection mechanism:
      synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s
      future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that
      this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\n\nPrompt LM with 100 most
      recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given
      a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\n\n\nPlanning
      & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\n\nPlanning
      is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X''s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\n\n\nFig.
      13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\nThis
      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\nProof-of-Concept
      Examples#\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting
      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of
      reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a
      cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\nHere
      is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\nYou are
      {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\nYour decisions must always
      be made independently without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths
      as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1.
      {{user-provided goal 1}}\n2. {{user-provided goal 2}}\n3. ...\n4. ...\n5. ...\n\nConstraints:\n1.
      ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so
      immediately save important information to files.\n2. If you are unsure how you
      previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar
      events will help you remember.\n3. No user assistance\n4. Exclusively use the
      commands listed in double quotes e.g. \"command name\"\n5. Use subprocesses
      for commands that will not terminate within a few minutes", "role": "system"}],

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\nAgent System Overview#\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\n\nPlanning\n\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down
      large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of
      complex tasks.\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and
      self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future
      steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\n\n\nMemory\n\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\n\n\nTool use\n\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra
      information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after
      pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access
      to proprietary information sources and more.", "role": "system"}], "model":

      4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common
      failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash,
      2023)\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve
      on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs,
      each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h =
      \\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is
      a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding
      human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by
      reward, $r_n \\geq r_{n-1} \\geq \\dots \\geq r_1$ The process is supervised
      fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\tau_h = (x, z_i,
      y_i, z_j, y_j, \\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$. The model
      is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix,
      such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback
      sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with
      human annotators at test time.\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization
      term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting
      and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they
      randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\nThe training dataset
      in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from
      human feedback and human preference dataset.\n\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with
      CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement
      in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\nThe idea of CoH is to present
      a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to
      take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin
      et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement
      learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned
      policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times
      and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning
      history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted
      action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn
      the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\n\nFig.
      6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin
      et al. 2023).\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set
      of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral
      cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies,
      each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run,
      a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used
      for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\nIn reality, the
      model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough
      to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes
      are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence
      of in-context RL requires long enough context.\nIn comparison with three baselines,
      including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories
      instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories
      for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since
      it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting
      close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other
      baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy,
      AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.", "role": "system"}], "model":

    body: '{"messages": [{"content": "Write a concise summary of the following:\\n\\nWith
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user''s request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\n\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\n\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API
      call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\n\nWhether an API call is needed.\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\n\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\n\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\n\nCase
      Studies#\nScientific Discovery Agent#\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\n\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\n\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\nFor example, when requested
      to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following

      context length: The restricted context capacity limits the inclusion of historical
      information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses. The design
      of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms
      like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long
      or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide
      access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful
      as full attention.\n\n\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition:
      Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space
      remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected
      errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and
      error.\n\n\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system
      relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components
      such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable,
      as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior
      (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo
      code focuses on parsing model output.\n\n\nCitation#\nCited as:\n\nWeng, Lilian.

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\nTypes of
      Memory#\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain,
      and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\n\n\nSensory
      Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain
      impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original
      stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds.
      Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and
      haptic memory (touch).\n\n\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores
      information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive
      tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have
      the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\n\n\nLong-Term
      Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time,
      ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity.
      There are two subtypes of LTM:\n\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory
      of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled,
      including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts
      and concepts).\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious
      and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding
      a bike or typing on a keyboard.\n\n\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\nWe
      can roughly consider the following mappings:\n\nSensory memory as learning embedding
      representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\nShort-term
      memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by
      the finite context window length of Transformer.\nLong-term memory as the external
      vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast
      retrieval.\n\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\nThe external memory can
      alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is
      to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database
      that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval
      speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200b algorithm
      to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy
      lost for a huge speedup.\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast

      1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\nComponent One: Planning#\nA
      complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they
      are and plan ahead.\nTask Decomposition#\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al.
      2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance
      on complex tasks. The model is instructed to \u201cthink step by step\u201d
      to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and
      simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed
      lights into an interpretation of the model\u2019s thinking process.\nTree of
      Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities
      at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and
      generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search
      process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each
      state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nTask decomposition
      can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What
      are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions;
      e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201cProblem
      PDDL\u201d, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201cDomain PDDL\u201d, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\nSelf-Reflection#\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous
      agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting
      previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and
      error are inevitable.\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting
      within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\nThought:
      ...\nAction: ...\nObservation: ...\n... (Repeated many times)\n\nFig. 2.  Examples
      of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER)
      and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et
      al. 2023).\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\n\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.", "role": "system"}], "model": "gpt-4o-mini", "n": 1, "stream":

      10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating
      in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not
      comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\nMRKL (Karpas et
      al. 2022), short for \u201cModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201d,
      is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed
      to contain a collection of \u201cexpert\u201d modules and the general-purpose
      LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module.
      These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math
      calculator, currency converter, weather API).\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning
      LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments
      showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated
      math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the
      right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when
      the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use
      the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented
      Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune
      a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether
      a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs.
      See more details in the \u201cExternal APIs\u201d section of Prompt Engineering.\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\n\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\nInstruction:\n\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\",
      task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\":
      URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of
      the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies
      on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and
      video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from
      the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship
      between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can''t be parsed,
      you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{
      Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From
      this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for
      your task planning.\n\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert
      models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented
      with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task
      type based filtration is needed.\nInstruction:\n\nGiven the user request and
      the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model
      from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs
      the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON
      format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We
      have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please
      select one model from the list.\n\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute
      on the specific tasks and log results.\nInstruction:", "role": "system"}], "model":

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks
      down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling
      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism
      and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for
      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"type\":\"system\"}}]]},\"outputs\":{\"generations\":[[{\"text\":\"The

      1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA
      complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they
      are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al.
      2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance
      on complex tasks. The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D
      to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and
      simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed
      lights into an interpretation of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of
      Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities
      at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and
      generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search
      process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each
      state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition
      can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\",
      \\\"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific
      instructions; e.g. \\\"Write a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3)
      with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023),
      involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning.
      This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an
      intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM
      (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests
      a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing \u201CDomain
      PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language.
      Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the
      availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common
      in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection
      is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining
      past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role
      in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al.
      2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space
      to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space.
      The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia
      search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in
      natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for
      LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation:
      ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories
      for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks
      (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments
      on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than
      the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn
      & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection
      capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup,
      in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space
      follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented
      with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the
      agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment
      to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3.
      Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe
      heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains
      hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories
      that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering
      a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation
      in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples
      to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for
      guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent\u2019s
      working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\"},\"outputs\":{\"summaries\":[\"The

      a concise summary of the following:\\\\n\\\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered
      autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually
      involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask
      Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard
      prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model
      is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time computation
      to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks
      into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the
      model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"type\":\"system\"}}]]},\"outputs\":{\"generations\":[[{\"text\":\"The

      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific

      a concise summary of the following:\\\\n\\\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld
      Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning
      in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH;
      Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly
      presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback.
      Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$,
      where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human
      rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback.
      Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq
      \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is
      a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n,
      y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only
      predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model
      can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The
      model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators
      at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize
      the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying
      (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask
      0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments
      is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and
      human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model
      can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a
      sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a
      history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to
      take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin
      et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement
      learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned
      policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times
      and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning
      history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted
      action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn
      the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig.
      6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin
      et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set
      of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral
      cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies,
      each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run,
      a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used
      for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the
      model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough
      to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes
      are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence
      of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines,
      including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories
      instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories
      for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since
      it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting
      close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other
      baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy,
      AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"type\":\"system\"}}]]},\"outputs\":{\"generations\":[[{\"text\":\"The

      embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term
      memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by
      the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external
      vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast
      retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can
      alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is
      to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database
      that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval
      speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm
      to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy

      applications of HuggingGPT, several challenges must be addressed, including
      improving efficiency, managing long context windows for complex tasks, and stabilizing
      output quality. The API-Bank benchmark evaluates tool-augmented LLMs through
      53 APIs and 264 annotated dialogues, assessing their decision-making capabilities
      at three levels: calling APIs, retrieving the right APIs, and planning multiple
      API calls for complex requests.\\n\\nCase studies like ChemCrow demonstrate
      the effectiveness of LLMs augmented with expert tools for scientific tasks,
      revealing that while LLMs may perform similarly in evaluations, expert assessments
      show significant advantages for specialized tools. This highlights the limitations
      of LLMs in self-evaluating their performance in expert domains.\",\"additional_kwargs\":{\"refusal\":null},\"response_metadata\":{\"token_usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":197,\"prompt_tokens\":943,\"total_tokens\":1140,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}},\"model_name\":\"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\",\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_1bb46167f9\",\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"logprobs\":null},\"type\":\"ai\",\"id\":\"run-004a9f8d-4452-4170-a475-8227451fbbc2-0\",\"usage_metadata\":{\"input_tokens\":943,\"output_tokens\":197,\"total_tokens\":1140},\"tool_calls\":[],\"invalid_tool_calls\":[]}}}]],\"llm_output\":{\"token_usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":197,\"prompt_tokens\":943,\"total_tokens\":1140,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}},\"model_name\":\"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\",\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_1bb46167f9\"},\"run\":null,\"type\":\"LLMResult\"},\"events\":[{\"name\":\"start\",\"time\":\"2024-09-25T22:31:24.663971+00:00\"},{\"name\":\"end\",\"time\":\"2024-09-25T22:31:27.032137+00:00\"}]},{\"id\":\"53367cc3-2062-4b4b-b94f-e82ef4e48185\",\"name\":\"generate_summary\",\"trace_id\":\"e1dce1c9-1dd8-4a52-ac64-60e3b07caad9\",\"parent_run_id\":\"e1dce1c9-1dd8-4a52-ac64-60e3b07caad9\",\"dotted_order\":\"20240925T223124641048Ze1dce1c9-1dd8-4a52-ac64-60e3b07caad9.20240925T223124647175Z53367cc3-2062-4b4b-b94f-e82ef4e48185\",\"tags\":[\"graph:step:1\"],\"extra\":{\"metadata\":{\"langgraph_step\":1,\"langgraph_node\":\"generate_summary\",\"langgraph_triggers\":[\"__pregel_push\"],\"langgraph_path\":[\"__pregel_push\",7],\"langgraph_checkpoint_ns\":\"generate_summary:3111f062-8402-d8aa-c651-dec4e9608b97\",\"revision_id\":\"langchain-experimental==0.3.1-32-g184428cfd-dirty\"},\"runtime\":{\"sdk\":\"langsmith-py\",\"sdk_version\":\"0.1.128\",\"library\":\"langsmith\",\"platform\":\"macOS-14.6-arm64-arm-64bit\",\"runtime\":\"python\",\"py_implementation\":\"CPython\",\"runtime_version\":\"3.11.7\",\"langchain_version\":\"0.3.0\",\"langchain_core_version\":\"0.3.5\"}},\"end_time\":\"2024-09-25T22:31:26.782157+00:00\",\"inputs\":{\"content\":\"inquired

      (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar
      input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the
      number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\nANNOY (Approximate
      Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees,
      a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting
      the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built
      independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function.
      ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half
      that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite
      related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small
      World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes
      can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201csix
      degrees of separation\u201d feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical
      layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual
      data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When
      performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates
      towards the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the
      next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers
      can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the
      lower layers refines the search quality.\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search):
      It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between
      nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering
      of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector
      space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search
      first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further
      looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors):
      The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes
      a data point $x_i$ to $\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\langle q,
      x_i \\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\angle q, \\tilde{x}_i$
      as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\n\n\nFig.

      a concise summary of the following:\\\\n\\\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing):
      It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to
      the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much
      smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh
      Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle
      q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$
      as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\"},\"outputs\":{\"summaries\":[\"The
      text discusses various algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search, each
      with unique methodologies:\\n\\n1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**: A hashing
      function that maps similar items to the same buckets with high probability,
      using fewer buckets than inputs.\\n\\n2. **ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah)**: Utilizes random projection trees to split input space and store
      data points in leaves, mimicking a hashing function for scalable searches.\\n\\n3.
      **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Builds hierarchical small-world
      graphs to facilitate efficient searches by navigating through layers, starting
      from a random node in the top layer.\\n\\n4. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity
      Search)**: Assumes Gaussian distribution in high-dimensional space, using vector
      quantization to cluster data points and refine searches within those clusters.\\n\\n5.
      **ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)**: Innovates with anisotropic vector quantization
      to ensure that the quantized representation closely resembles the original distance
      metrics.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the importance of tool use in enhancing

      write a plausible implementation.\nInclude module dependency or package manager
      dependency definition file.\nBefore you finish, double check that all parts
      of the architecture is present in the files.\nUseful to know:\nYou almost always
      put different classes in different files.\nFor Python, you always create an
      appropriate requirements.txt file.\nFor NodeJS, you always create an appropriate
      package.json file.\nYou always add a comment briefly describing the purpose
      of the function definition.\nYou try to add comments explaining very complex
      bits of logic.\nYou always follow the best practices for the requested languages
      in terms of describing the code written as a defined\npackage/project.\nPython

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks
      down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling
      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism
      and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for
      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"Fig. 1. Overview of
      a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt,
      each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$
      is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback
      tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$
      The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form
      of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq
      i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned
      on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better
      output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple
      rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting,
      CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5.
      After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs
      with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD)
      works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any
      algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a
      neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data
      is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task.
      At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence
      of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy
      is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length,
      so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic
      contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL
      algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn
      comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior
      cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy
      (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al.
      2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context
      RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and
      learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training
      history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"Fig.

      memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes
      of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,
      retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in
      human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory,
      providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,
      auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically
      only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual),
      echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory
      (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of
      and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.
      Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller
      1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts
      and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\",\"LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are
      mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets
      is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\",\"Fig. 10. A picture
      of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.
      While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with
      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201CModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201D, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201Cexpert\u201D modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201CExternal APIs\u201D section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\",
      task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text,
      \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\"
      field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that
      the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated
      text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task
      MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There
      is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user
      input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases
      for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{
      Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned
      resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes
      the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice
      question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the
      limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven
      the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select
      a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant
      merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be
      in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail
      reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{
      Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution:
      Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\",\"With
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an
      API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase
      Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested
      to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\",\"inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected
      a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed
      the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test
      set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to
      synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis
      solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure.
      7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after
      a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents
      Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment
      where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living
      and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents
      create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe
      design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection
      mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well
      as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory
      module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019
      experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event
      directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new
      natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to
      inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency:
      recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core
      memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current
      situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher
      level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They
      are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different
      from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations
      and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
      Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate
      the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is
      essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\nFig.
      13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis
      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept
      Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting
      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of
      reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a
      cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\",\"Finite context length: The restricted context
      capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited

      memory, and tool use. \\n\\n1. **Planning** involves task decomposition into
      smaller subgoals and self-reflection to improve future actions.\\n2. **Memory**
      is categorized into short-term (in-context learning) and long-term (retaining
      information using external storage).\\n3. **Tool Use** allows agents to access
      external APIs for additional information and capabilities beyond their pre-trained
      knowledge.\\n\\nThe article highlights various proof-of-concept examples, such
      as AutoGPT and BabyAGI, showcasing the potential of LLMs as general problem
      solvers. It also addresses the challenges faced in building these agents.\",\"The
      overview describes a LLM-powered autonomous agent system that incorporates planning
      and self-reflection components. \\n\\n1. **Planning**: The system employs task
      decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
      to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step
      reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths at each step using search
      algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an external classical planner using
      Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2.
      **Self-Reflection**: This component allows agents to iteratively improve by
      analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting, enabling
      agents to interact with their environment while generating reasoning traces.
      Reflexion enhances this by incorporating dynamic memory and a reward model to
      assess the efficiency of actions and correct mistakes. It uses heuristics to
      identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations, and integrates reflections
      from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall, the system aims
      to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks through structured
      planning and self-improvement mechanisms.\",\"The experiments on AlfWorld Env
      and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination is a more prevalent failure than inefficient
      planning. The Chain of Hindsight (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing
      a sequence of past outputs with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect
      and improve. CoH employs supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to
      prevent overfitting and incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting.
      The training dataset combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning,
      models show incremental improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation
      (AD) applies a similar concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of
      learning trajectories to inform future actions, leading to better performance
      than traditional methods. AD demonstrates effective in-context reinforcement
      learning, achieving results close to online RL methods while learning faster
      than other baselines.\",\"The text discusses the comparison of various reinforcement
      learning (RL) methods, including AD, ED, source policy, and RL^2, in environments
      that require memory and exploration, with a focus on binary rewards. It highlights
      the types of memory in human brains: sensory memory (short-lived impressions
      of sensory information), short-term memory (limited capacity for current awareness),
      and long-term memory (unlimited storage for facts and experiences). The categorization
      of human memory is mapped to machine learning concepts, where sensory memory
      corresponds to learning embeddings, short-term memory relates to in-context
      learning, and long-term memory is likened to external vector stores for fast
      retrieval. The text also introduces Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) as a
      method to enhance retrieval speed from external memory, utilizing approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms for efficient data access.\",\"The text discusses
      various algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search, each with unique
      methodologies:\\n\\n1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**: A hashing function
      that maps similar items to the same buckets with high probability, using fewer
      buckets than inputs.\\n\\n2. **ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**:

      the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the role of external
      tools in extending their functionality.\",\"The text discusses various advancements

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous

      key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks
      down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling
      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism
      and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for
      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"Fig. 1. Overview of
      a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt,
      each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$
      is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback
      tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$
      The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form
      of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq
      i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned
      on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better
      output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple
      rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting,
      CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5.
      After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs
      with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD)
      works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any
      algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a
      neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data
      is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task.
      At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence
      of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy
      is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length,
      so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic
      contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL
      algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn
      comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior
      cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy
      (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al.
      2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context
      RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and
      learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training
      history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"Fig.

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes
      of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,
      retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in
      human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory,
      providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,
      auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically
      only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual),
      echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory
      (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of
      and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.
      Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller
      1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts
      and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\",\"LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are
      mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets
      is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things

      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201CModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201D, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201Cexpert\u201D modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201CExternal APIs\u201D section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\",
      task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text,
      \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\"
      field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that
      the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated
      text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task
      MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There
      is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user
      input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases
      for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{
      Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned
      resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes
      the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice
      question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the
      limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven
      the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select
      a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant
      merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be
      in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail
      reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{
      Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution:
      Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\",\"With
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an
      API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase
      Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested
      to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\",\"inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected
      a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed
      the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test
      set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to
      synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis
      solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure.
      7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after
      a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents
      Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment
      where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living
      and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents
      create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe
      design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection
      mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well
      as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory
      module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019
      experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event
      directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new
      natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to
      inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency:
      recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core
      memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current
      situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher
      level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They
      are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different
      from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations
      and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
      Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate
      the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is
      essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\nFig.
      13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis
      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept
      Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting
      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of
      reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a
      cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\",\"Finite context length: The restricted context
      capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited

      article \\\"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\\" by Lilian Weng discusses the concept
      of using large language models (LLMs) as the core controller for autonomous
      agents. It outlines a system overview that includes three main components: planning,
      memory, and tool use. \\n\\n1. **Planning** involves task decomposition into
      smaller subgoals and self-reflection to improve future actions.\\n2. **Memory**
      is categorized into short-term (in-context learning) and long-term (retaining
      information using external storage).\\n3. **Tool Use** allows agents to access
      external APIs for additional information and capabilities beyond their pre-trained
      knowledge.\\n\\nThe article highlights various proof-of-concept examples, such
      as AutoGPT and BabyAGI, showcasing the potential of LLMs as general problem
      solvers. It also addresses the challenges faced in building these agents.\",\"The
      overview describes a LLM-powered autonomous agent system that incorporates planning
      and self-reflection components. \\n\\n1. **Planning**: The system employs task
      decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
      to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step
      reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths at each step using search
      algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an external classical planner using
      Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2.
      **Self-Reflection**: This component allows agents to iteratively improve by
      analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting, enabling
      agents to interact with their environment while generating reasoning traces.
      Reflexion enhances this by incorporating dynamic memory and a reward model to
      assess the efficiency of actions and correct mistakes. It uses heuristics to
      identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations, and integrates reflections
      from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall, the system aims
      to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks through structured
      planning and self-improvement mechanisms.\",\"The experiments on AlfWorld Env
      and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination is a more prevalent failure than inefficient
      planning. The Chain of Hindsight (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing
      a sequence of past outputs with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect
      and improve. CoH employs supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to
      prevent overfitting and incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting.
      The training dataset combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning,
      models show incremental improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation
      (AD) applies a similar concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of
      learning trajectories to inform future actions, leading to better performance
      than traditional methods. AD demonstrates effective in-context reinforcement
      learning, achieving results close to online RL methods while learning faster
      than other baselines.\",\"The text discusses the comparison of various reinforcement
      learning (RL) methods, including AD, ED, source policy, and RL^2, in environments
      that require memory and exploration, with a focus on binary rewards. It highlights
      the types of memory in human brains: sensory memory (short-lived impressions
      of sensory information), short-term memory (limited capacity for current awareness),
      and long-term memory (unlimited storage for facts and experiences). The categorization
      of human memory is mapped to machine learning concepts, where sensory memory
      corresponds to learning embeddings, short-term memory relates to in-context
      learning, and long-term memory is likened to external vector stores for fast
      retrieval. The text also introduces Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) as a
      method to enhance retrieval speed from external memory, utilizing approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms for efficient data access.\",\"The text discusses
      various algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search, each with unique
      methodologies:\\n\\n1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**: A hashing function
      that maps similar items to the same buckets with high probability, using fewer
      buckets than inputs.\\n\\n2. **ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**:
      Utilizes random projection trees to split input space and store data points
      in leaves, mimicking a hashing function for scalable searches.\\n\\n3. **HNSW
      (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Builds hierarchical small-world graphs
      to facilitate efficient searches by navigating through layers, starting from
      a random node in the top layer.\\n\\n4. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**:
      Assumes Gaussian distribution in high-dimensional space, using vector quantization
      to cluster data points and refine searches within those clusters.\\n\\n5. **ScaNN
      (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)**: Innovates with anisotropic vector quantization
      to ensure that the quantized representation closely resembles the original distance
      metrics.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the importance of tool use in enhancing
      the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the role of external
      tools in extending their functionality.\",\"The text discusses various advancements
      in neuro-symbolic architectures for autonomous agents, particularly focusing
      on MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language) systems, which utilize a
      combination of expert modules and a general-purpose language model (LLM) to
      route inquiries effectively. Experiments revealed challenges in LLMs extracting
      arguments for verbal math problems compared to explicit ones, emphasizing the
      importance of knowing when and how to use external symbolic tools. Other frameworks
      like TALM and Toolformer enhance LLMs' capabilities to utilize external tool
      APIs, while ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API function calling exemplify practical
      applications. HuggingGPT is introduced as a framework that employs ChatGPT for
      task planning, involving four stages: task planning, model selection, task execution,
      and logging results. The system is designed to parse user requests into manageable
      tasks and select appropriate models for execution.\",\"The AI assistant processes
      user input by following a structured workflow: User Input, Task Planning, Model
      Selection, and Task Execution. It first provides a direct response to the user's
      request, then details the task process and shares analysis and inference results,
      including any relevant file paths.\\n\\nTo enhance real-world applications of
      HuggingGPT, several challenges must be addressed, including improving efficiency,
      managing long context windows for complex tasks, and stabilizing output quality.
      The API-Bank benchmark evaluates tool-augmented LLMs through 53 APIs and 264
      annotated dialogues, assessing their decision-making capabilities at three levels:
      calling APIs, retrieving the right APIs, and planning multiple API calls for
      complex requests.\\n\\nCase studies like ChemCrow demonstrate the effectiveness
      of LLMs augmented with expert tools for scientific tasks, revealing that while
      LLMs may perform similarly in evaluations, expert assessments show significant
      advantages for specialized tools. This highlights the limitations of LLMs in
      self-evaluating their performance in expert domains.\",\"The text discusses
      a project focused on anticancer drug discovery, where a target was selected,
      a scaffold was requested, and a compound was synthesized. The project also addressed
      risks related to illicit drugs and bioweapons, leading to a test set of known
      chemical weapon agents. Out of 11 synthesis requests, 4 were accepted, while
      7 were rejected, primarily after web searches. \\n\\nAdditionally, it describes
      the Generative Agents Simulation, where 25 virtual characters interact in a
      sandbox environment, utilizing a combination of long-term memory, planning,
      and reflection mechanisms to simulate human behavior. The architecture allows
      for emergent social behaviors, such as information diffusion and event coordination.
      \\n\\nLastly, it mentions AutoGPT, an autonomous agent system that operates
      independently using a natural language interface, with specific goals and constraints,
      highlighting its potential and reliability issues.\",\"The provided commands
      outline a set of functionalities for managing tasks, including searching the

      analysis, and generating content. Key commands include starting and messaging
      GPT agents, executing file operations (read, write, delete), analyzing and improving
      code, and generating images or tweets. Resources available include internet
      access, memory management, and GPT-3.5 agents for task delegation. Performance
      evaluation emphasizes continuous self-assessment, efficiency in task execution,
      and strategic reflection to optimize actions. The system is trained on data
      up to October 2023.\",\"{\\n    \\\"thoughts\\\": {\\n        \\\"text\\\":

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks
      down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling
      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism
      and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for
      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"Fig. 1. Overview of
      a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt,
      each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$
      is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback
      tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$
      The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form
      of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq
      i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned
      on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better
      output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple
      rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting,
      CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5.
      After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs
      with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD)
      works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any
      algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a
      neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data
      is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task.
      At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence
      of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy
      is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length,
      so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic
      contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL
      algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn
      comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior
      cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy
      (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al.
      2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context
      RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and
      learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training
      history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"Fig.

      memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes
      of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,
      retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in
      human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory,
      providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,
      auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically
      only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual),
      echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory
      (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of
      and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.
      Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller
      1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts
      and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\",\"LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are
      mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets
      is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\",\"Fig. 10. A picture
      of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.
      While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with
      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201CModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201D, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201Cexpert\u201D modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201CExternal APIs\u201D section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\",
      task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text,
      \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\"
      field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that
      the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated
      text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task
      MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There
      is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user
      input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases
      for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{
      Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned
      resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes
      the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice
      question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the
      limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven
      the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select
      a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant
      merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be
      in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail
      reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{
      Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution:
      Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\",\"With
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an
      API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase
      Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested
      to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\",\"inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected
      a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed
      the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test
      set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to
      synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis
      solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure.
      7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after
      a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents
      Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment
      where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living
      and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents
      create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe
      design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection
      mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well
      as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory
      module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019
      experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event
      directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new
      natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to
      inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency:
      recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core
      memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current
      situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher
      level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They
      are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different
      from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations
      and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
      Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate
      the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is
      essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\nFig.

      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept
      Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting
      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of
      reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\",\"Finite context length: The restricted context
      capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited

      article \\\"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\\" by Lilian Weng discusses the concept
      of using large language models (LLMs) as the core controller for autonomous
      agents. It outlines a system overview that includes three main components: planning,
      memory, and tool use. \\n\\n1. **Planning** involves task decomposition into
      smaller subgoals and self-reflection to improve future actions.\\n2. **Memory**
      is categorized into short-term (in-context learning) and long-term (retaining
      information using external storage).\\n3. **Tool Use** allows agents to access
      external APIs for additional information and capabilities beyond their pre-trained
      knowledge.\\n\\nThe article highlights various proof-of-concept examples, such
      as AutoGPT and BabyAGI, showcasing the potential of LLMs as general problem
      solvers. It also addresses the challenges faced in building these agents.\",\"The
      overview describes a LLM-powered autonomous agent system that incorporates planning
      and self-reflection components. \\n\\n1. **Planning**: The system employs task
      decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
      to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step
      reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths at each step using search
      algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an external classical planner using
      Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2.
      **Self-Reflection**: This component allows agents to iteratively improve by
      analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting, enabling
      agents to interact with their environment while generating reasoning traces.
      Reflexion enhances this by incorporating dynamic memory and a reward model to
      assess the efficiency of actions and correct mistakes. It uses heuristics to
      identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations, and integrates reflections
      from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall, the system aims
      to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks through structured
      planning and self-improvement mechanisms.\",\"The experiments on AlfWorld Env
      and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination is a more prevalent failure than inefficient
      planning. The Chain of Hindsight (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing
      a sequence of past outputs with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect
      and improve. CoH employs supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to
      prevent overfitting and incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting.
      The training dataset combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning,
      models show incremental improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation
      (AD) applies a similar concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of
      learning trajectories to inform future actions, leading to better performance
      than traditional methods. AD demonstrates effective in-context reinforcement
      learning, achieving results close to online RL methods while learning faster
      than other baselines.\",\"The text discusses the comparison of various reinforcement
      learning (RL) methods, including AD, ED, source policy, and RL^2, in environments
      that require memory and exploration, with a focus on binary rewards. It highlights
      the types of memory in human brains: sensory memory (short-lived impressions
      of sensory information), short-term memory (limited capacity for current awareness),
      and long-term memory (unlimited storage for facts and experiences). The categorization
      of human memory is mapped to machine learning concepts, where sensory memory
      corresponds to learning embeddings, short-term memory relates to in-context
      learning, and long-term memory is likened to external vector stores for fast
      retrieval. The text also introduces Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) as a
      method to enhance retrieval speed from external memory, utilizing approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms for efficient data access.\",\"The text discusses
      various algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search, each with unique
      methodologies:\\n\\n1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**: A hashing function
      that maps similar items to the same buckets with high probability, using fewer
      buckets than inputs.\\n\\n2. **ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**:
      Utilizes random projection trees to split input space and store data points
      in leaves, mimicking a hashing function for scalable searches.\\n\\n3. **HNSW
      (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Builds hierarchical small-world graphs
      to facilitate efficient searches by navigating through layers, starting from
      a random node in the top layer.\\n\\n4. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**:
      Assumes Gaussian distribution in high-dimensional space, using vector quantization
      to cluster data points and refine searches within those clusters.\\n\\n5. **ScaNN
      (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)**: Innovates with anisotropic vector quantization
      to ensure that the quantized representation closely resembles the original distance
      metrics.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the importance of tool use in enhancing
      the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the role of external
      tools in extending their functionality.\",\"The text discusses various advancements
      in neuro-symbolic architectures for autonomous agents, particularly focusing
      on MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language) systems, which utilize a
      combination of expert modules and a general-purpose language model (LLM) to
      route inquiries effectively. Experiments revealed challenges in LLMs extracting
      arguments for verbal math problems compared to explicit ones, emphasizing the
      importance of knowing when and how to use external symbolic tools. Other frameworks
      like TALM and Toolformer enhance LLMs' capabilities to utilize external tool

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks
      down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling
      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism
      and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for
      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"Fig. 1. Overview of
      a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt,
      each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$
      is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback
      tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$
      The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form
      of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq
      i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned
      on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better
      output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple
      rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting,
      CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5.
      After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs
      with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD)
      works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any
      algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a
      neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data
      is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task.
      At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence
      of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy
      is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length,
      so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic
      contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL
      algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn
      comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior
      cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy
      (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al.
      2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context
      RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and
      learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training
      history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"Fig.

      memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes
      of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,
      retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in
      human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory,
      providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,
      auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically
      only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual),
      echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory
      (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of
      and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.
      Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller
      1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts
      and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\",\"LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are
      mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets
      is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\",\"Fig. 10. A picture
      of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.
      While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with
      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201CModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201D, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201Cexpert\u201D modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201CExternal APIs\u201D section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\",
      task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text,
      \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\"
      field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that
      the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated
      text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task
      MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There
      is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user
      input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases
      for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{
      Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned
      resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes
      the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice
      question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the
      limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven
      the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select
      a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant
      merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be
      in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail
      reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{
      Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution:
      Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\",\"With
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an
      API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase
      Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested
      to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\",\"inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected
      a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed
      the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test
      set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to
      synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis
      solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure.
      7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after
      a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents
      Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment
      where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living
      and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents
      create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe
      design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection
      mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well
      as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory
      module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019
      experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event
      directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new
      natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to
      inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency:
      recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core
      memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current
      situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher
      level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They
      are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different
      from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations
      and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
      Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate
      the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is
      essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\nFig.
      13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis
      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept
      Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting
      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of
      reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\",\"Finite context length: The restricted context
      capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited

      decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
      to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step
      reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths at each step using search
      algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an external classical planner using
      Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2.
      **Self-Reflection**: This component allows agents to iteratively improve by
      analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting, enabling
      agents to interact with their environment while generating reasoning traces.
      Reflexion enhances this by incorporating dynamic memory and a reward model to
      assess the efficiency of actions and correct mistakes. It uses heuristics to
      identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations, and integrates reflections
      from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall, the system aims
      to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks through structured
      planning and self-improvement mechanisms.\",\"The experiments on AlfWorld Env
      and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination is a more prevalent failure than inefficient
      planning. The Chain of Hindsight (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing
      a sequence of past outputs with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect
      and improve. CoH employs supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to
      prevent overfitting and incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting.
      The training dataset combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning,
      models show incremental improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation
      (AD) applies a similar concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of
      learning trajectories to inform future actions, leading to better performance

      self-reflection that could benefit from longer context windows. While vector
      stores can provide broader knowledge access, they lack the representation power
      of full attention. Additionally, LLMs face challenges in long-term planning
      and task decomposition, struggling to adapt plans in response to unexpected
      errors, which diminishes their robustness compared to human learning. The reliance
      on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components raises

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous

      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism

      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"Fig. 1. Overview of
      a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt,
      each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$
      is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback
      tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$
      The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form
      of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq
      i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned
      on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better
      output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple
      rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting,
      CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5.
      After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs
      with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD)
      works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any
      algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a
      neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data
      is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task.
      At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence
      of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy
      is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length,
      so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic
      contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL
      algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn
      comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior
      cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy
      (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al.
      2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context
      RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and
      learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training
      history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"Fig.

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes
      of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,
      retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in
      human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory,
      providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,
      auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically
      only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual),
      echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory
      (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of
      and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.
      Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller
      1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts
      and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\",\"LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are
      mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets
      is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\",\"Fig. 10. A picture
      of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.
      While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with
      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201CModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201D, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201Cexpert\u201D modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201CExternal APIs\u201D section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\",
      task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text,
      \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\"
      field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that
      the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated
      text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task
      MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There
      is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user
      input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases
      for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{
      Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned
      resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes
      the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice
      question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the
      limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven
      the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select
      a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant
      merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be
      in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail
      reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{
      Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution:
      Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\",\"With
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an
      API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase
      Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested
      to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\",\"inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected
      a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed
      the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test
      set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to
      synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis
      solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure.
      7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after
      a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents
      Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment
      where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living
      and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents
      create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe
      design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection
      mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well
      as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory
      module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019
      experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event
      directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new
      natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to
      inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency:
      recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core
      memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current
      situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher
      level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They
      are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different
      from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations
      and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
      Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate
      the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is
      essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\nFig.

      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept

      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\",\"Finite context length: The restricted context
      capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited

      article \\\"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\\" by Lilian Weng discusses the concept
      of using large language models (LLMs) as the core controller for autonomous
      agents. It outlines a system overview that includes three main components: planning,
      memory, and tool use. \\n\\n1. **Planning** involves task decomposition into
      smaller subgoals and self-reflection to improve future actions.\\n2. **Memory**
      is categorized into short-term (in-context learning) and long-term (retaining
      information using external storage).\\n3. **Tool Use** allows agents to access
      external APIs for additional information and capabilities beyond their pre-trained
      knowledge.\\n\\nThe article highlights various proof-of-concept examples, such
      as AutoGPT and BabyAGI, showcasing the potential of LLMs as general problem
      solvers. It also addresses the challenges faced in building these agents.\",\"The
      overview describes a LLM-powered autonomous agent system that incorporates planning
      and self-reflection components. \\n\\n1. **Planning**: The system employs task
      decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
      to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step
      reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths at each step using search
      algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an external classical planner using
      Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2.
      **Self-Reflection**: This component allows agents to iteratively improve by
      analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting, enabling
      agents to interact with their environment while generating reasoning traces.
      Reflexion enhances this by incorporating dynamic memory and a reward model to
      assess the efficiency of actions and correct mistakes. It uses heuristics to
      identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations, and integrates reflections
      from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall, the system aims
      to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks through structured
      planning and self-improvement mechanisms.\",\"The experiments on AlfWorld Env
      and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination is a more prevalent failure than inefficient
      planning. The Chain of Hindsight (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing
      a sequence of past outputs with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect
      and improve. CoH employs supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to
      prevent overfitting and incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting.
      The training dataset combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning,
      models show incremental improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation
      (AD) applies a similar concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of
      learning trajectories to inform future actions, leading to better performance
      than traditional methods. AD demonstrates effective in-context reinforcement
      learning, achieving results close to online RL methods while learning faster
      than other baselines.\",\"The text discusses the comparison of various reinforcement
      learning (RL) methods, including AD, ED, source policy, and RL^2, in environments
      that require memory and exploration, with a focus on binary rewards. It highlights
      the types of memory in human brains: sensory memory (short-lived impressions
      of sensory information), short-term memory (limited capacity for current awareness),
      and long-term memory (unlimited storage for facts and experiences). The categorization
      of human memory is mapped to machine learning concepts, where sensory memory
      corresponds to learning embeddings, short-term memory relates to in-context
      learning, and long-term memory is likened to external vector stores for fast
      retrieval. The text also introduces Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) as a
      method to enhance retrieval speed from external memory, utilizing approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms for efficient data access.\",\"The text discusses
      various algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search, each with unique
      methodologies:\\n\\n1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**: A hashing function
      that maps similar items to the same buckets with high probability, using fewer
      buckets than inputs.\\n\\n2. **ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**:
      Utilizes random projection trees to split input space and store data points
      in leaves, mimicking a hashing function for scalable searches.\\n\\n3. **HNSW
      (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Builds hierarchical small-world graphs
      to facilitate efficient searches by navigating through layers, starting from
      a random node in the top layer.\\n\\n4. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**:
      Assumes Gaussian distribution in high-dimensional space, using vector quantization
      to cluster data points and refine searches within those clusters.\\n\\n5. **ScaNN
      (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)**: Innovates with anisotropic vector quantization
      to ensure that the quantized representation closely resembles the original distance
      metrics.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the importance of tool use in enhancing
      the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the role of external
      tools in extending their functionality.\",\"The text discusses various advancements
      in neuro-symbolic architectures for autonomous agents, particularly focusing
      on MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language) systems, which utilize a
      combination of expert modules and a general-purpose language model (LLM) to
      route inquiries effectively. Experiments revealed challenges in LLMs extracting
      arguments for verbal math problems compared to explicit ones, emphasizing the
      importance of knowing when and how to use external symbolic tools. Other frameworks
      like TALM and Toolformer enhance LLMs' capabilities to utilize external tool
      APIs, while ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API function calling exemplify practical
      applications. HuggingGPT is introduced as a framework that employs ChatGPT for
      task planning, involving four stages: task planning, model selection, task execution,
      and logging results. The system is designed to parse user requests into manageable
      tasks and select appropriate models for execution.\",\"The AI assistant processes
      user input by following a structured workflow: User Input, Task Planning, Model
      Selection, and Task Execution. It first provides a direct response to the user's
      request, then details the task process and shares analysis and inference results,
      including any relevant file paths.\\n\\nTo enhance real-world applications of
      HuggingGPT, several challenges must be addressed, including improving efficiency,
      managing long context windows for complex tasks, and stabilizing output quality.
      The API-Bank benchmark evaluates tool-augmented LLMs through 53 APIs and 264
      annotated dialogues, assessing their decision-making capabilities at three levels:
      calling APIs, retrieving the right APIs, and planning multiple API calls for
      complex requests.\\n\\nCase studies like ChemCrow demonstrate the effectiveness
      of LLMs augmented with expert tools for scientific tasks, revealing that while
      LLMs may perform similarly in evaluations, expert assessments show significant
      advantages for specialized tools. This highlights the limitations of LLMs in
      self-evaluating their performance in expert domains.\",\"The text discusses
      a project focused on anticancer drug discovery, where a target was selected,
      a scaffold was requested, and a compound was synthesized. The project also addressed
      risks related to illicit drugs and bioweapons, leading to a test set of known
      chemical weapon agents. Out of 11 synthesis requests, 4 were accepted, while
      7 were rejected, primarily after web searches. \\n\\nAdditionally, it describes
      the Generative Agents Simulation, where 25 virtual characters interact in a
      sandbox environment, utilizing a combination of long-term memory, planning,
      and reflection mechanisms to simulate human behavior. The architecture allows
      for emergent social behaviors, such as information diffusion and event coordination.
      \\n\\nLastly, it mentions AutoGPT, an autonomous agent system that operates
      independently using a natural language interface, with specific goals and constraints,
      highlighting its potential and reliability issues.\",\"The provided commands
      outline a set of functionalities for managing tasks, including searching the

      analysis, and generating content. Key commands include starting and messaging
      GPT agents, executing file operations (read, write, delete), analyzing and improving
      code, and generating images or tweets. Resources available include internet
      access, memory management, and GPT-3.5 agents for task delegation. Performance
      evaluation emphasizes continuous self-assessment, efficiency in task execution,
      and strategic reflection to optimize actions. The system is trained on data

      page_content=''The article \"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\" by Lilian Weng
      discusses the concept of using large language models (LLMs) as the core controller
      for autonomous agents. It outlines a system overview that includes three main
      components: planning, memory, and tool use. \\n\\n1. **Planning** involves task
      decomposition into smaller subgoals and self-reflection to improve future actions.\\n2.
      **Memory** is categorized into short-term (in-context learning) and long-term
      (retaining information using external storage).\\n3. **Tool Use** allows agents
      to access external APIs for additional information and capabilities beyond their
      pre-trained knowledge.\\n\\nThe article highlights various proof-of-concept
      examples, such as AutoGPT and BabyAGI, showcasing the potential of LLMs as general
      problem solvers. It also addresses the challenges faced in building these agents.''),
      Document(metadata={}, page_content=''The overview describes a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system that incorporates planning and self-reflection components. \\n\\n1.
      **Planning**: The system employs task decomposition techniques like Chain of
      Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) to break down complex tasks into manageable
      steps. CoT encourages step-by-step reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning
      paths at each step using search algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an
      external classical planner using Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL)
      for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2. **Self-Reflection**: This component allows
      agents to iteratively improve by analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework
      combines reasoning and acting, enabling agents to interact with their environment
      while generating reasoning traces. Reflexion enhances this by incorporating
      dynamic memory and a reward model to assess the efficiency of actions and correct
      mistakes. It uses heuristics to identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations,
      and integrates reflections from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall,
      the system aims to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks
      through structured planning and self-improvement mechanisms.''), Document(metadata={},
      page_content=''The experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination
      is a more prevalent failure than inefficient planning. The Chain of Hindsight
      (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing a sequence of past outputs
      with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect and improve. CoH employs
      supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to prevent overfitting and
      incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting. The training dataset
      combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning, models show incremental
      improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation (AD) applies a similar
      concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of learning trajectories
      to inform future actions, leading to better performance than traditional methods.
      AD demonstrates effective in-context reinforcement learning, achieving results
      close to online RL methods while learning faster than other baselines.''), Document(metadata={},
      page_content=''The text discusses the comparison of various reinforcement learning
      (RL) methods, including AD, ED, source policy, and RL^2, in environments that
      require memory and exploration, with a focus on binary rewards. It highlights
      the types of memory in human brains: sensory memory (short-lived impressions
      of sensory information), short-term memory (limited capacity for current awareness),
      and long-term memory (unlimited storage for facts and experiences). The categorization
      of human memory is mapped to machine learning concepts, where sensory memory
      corresponds to learning embeddings, short-term memory relates to in-context
      learning, and long-term memory is likened to external vector stores for fast
      retrieval. The text also introduces Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) as a
      method to enhance retrieval speed from external memory, utilizing approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms for efficient data access.''), Document(metadata={},
      page_content=''The text discusses various algorithms for approximate nearest
      neighbor search, each with unique methodologies:\\n\\n1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing)**: A hashing function that maps similar items to the same buckets with
      high probability, using fewer buckets than inputs.\\n\\n2. **ANNOY (Approximate
      Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**: Utilizes random projection trees to split input
      space and store data points in leaves, mimicking a hashing function for scalable
      searches.\\n\\n3. **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Builds hierarchical
      small-world graphs to facilitate efficient searches by navigating through layers,
      starting from a random node in the top layer.\\n\\n4. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity
      Search)**: Assumes Gaussian distribution in high-dimensional space, using vector
      quantization to cluster data points and refine searches within those clusters.\\n\\n5.
      **ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)**: Innovates with anisotropic vector quantization
      to ensure that the quantized representation closely resembles the original distance
      metrics.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the importance of tool use in enhancing
      the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the role of external
      tools in extending their functionality.'')]\n    Take these and distill it into

      for autonomous agents, particularly focusing on MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge
      and Language) systems, which utilize a combination of expert modules and a general-purpose
      language model (LLM) to route inquiries effectively. Experiments revealed challenges
      in LLMs extracting arguments for verbal math problems compared to explicit ones,
      emphasizing the importance of knowing when and how to use external symbolic
      tools. Other frameworks like TALM and Toolformer enhance LLMs'' capabilities
      to utilize external tool APIs, while ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API function
      calling exemplify practical applications. HuggingGPT is introduced as a framework
      that employs ChatGPT for task planning, involving four stages: task planning,
      model selection, task execution, and logging results. The system is designed
      to parse user requests into manageable tasks and select appropriate models for
      execution.\"), Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"The AI assistant processes
      user input by following a structured workflow: User Input, Task Planning, Model
      Selection, and Task Execution. It first provides a direct response to the user''s
      request, then details the task process and shares analysis and inference results,
      including any relevant file paths.\\n\\nTo enhance real-world applications of
      HuggingGPT, several challenges must be addressed, including improving efficiency,
      managing long context windows for complex tasks, and stabilizing output quality.
      The API-Bank benchmark evaluates tool-augmented LLMs through 53 APIs and 264
      annotated dialogues, assessing their decision-making capabilities at three levels:
      calling APIs, retrieving the right APIs, and planning multiple API calls for
      complex requests.\\n\\nCase studies like ChemCrow demonstrate the effectiveness
      of LLMs augmented with expert tools for scientific tasks, revealing that while
      LLMs may perform similarly in evaluations, expert assessments show significant
      advantages for specialized tools. This highlights the limitations of LLMs in
      self-evaluating their performance in expert domains.\"), Document(metadata={},

      in LLMs restrict their ability to incorporate historical information and detailed
      instructions, hindering mechanisms like self-reflection that could benefit from
      longer context windows. While vector stores can provide broader knowledge access,

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks
      down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling
      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism
      and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for
      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"Fig. 1. Overview of
      a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt,
      each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$
      is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback
      tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$
      The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form
      of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq
      i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned
      on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better
      output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple
      rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting,
      CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5.
      After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs
      with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD)
      works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any
      algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a
      neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data
      is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task.
      At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence
      of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy
      is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length,
      so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic
      contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL
      algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn
      comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior
      cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy
      (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al.
      2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context
      RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and
      learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training
      history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"Fig.

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes
      of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,
      retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in
      human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory,
      providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,
      auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically
      only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual),
      echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory
      (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of
      and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.
      Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller
      1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts
      and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\",\"LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are
      mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets
      is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\",\"Fig. 10. A picture
      of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.
      While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with
      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201CModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201D, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201Cexpert\u201D modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201CExternal APIs\u201D section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\",
      task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text,
      \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\"
      field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that
      the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated
      text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task
      MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There
      is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user
      input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases
      for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{
      Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned
      resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes
      the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice
      question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the
      limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven
      the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select
      a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant
      merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be
      in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail
      reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{
      Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution:
      Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\",\"With
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an
      API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase
      Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested
      to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\",\"inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected
      a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed
      the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test
      set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to
      synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis
      solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure.
      7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after
      a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents
      Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment
      where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living
      and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents
      create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe
      design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection
      mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well
      as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory
      module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019
      experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event
      directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new
      natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to
      inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency:
      recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core
      memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current
      situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher
      level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They
      are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different
      from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations
      and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
      Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate
      the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is
      essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\nFig.
      13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis
      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept
      Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting
      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of
      reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a
      cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\",\"Finite context length: The restricted context
      capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited

      article \\\"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\\" by Lilian Weng discusses the concept
      of using large language models (LLMs) as the core controller for autonomous
      agents. It outlines a system overview that includes three main components: planning,
      memory, and tool use. \\n\\n1. **Planning** involves task decomposition into
      smaller subgoals and self-reflection to improve future actions.\\n2. **Memory**
      is categorized into short-term (in-context learning) and long-term (retaining
      information using external storage).\\n3. **Tool Use** allows agents to access
      external APIs for additional information and capabilities beyond their pre-trained
      knowledge.\\n\\nThe article highlights various proof-of-concept examples, such
      as AutoGPT and BabyAGI, showcasing the potential of LLMs as general problem
      solvers. It also addresses the challenges faced in building these agents.\",\"The
      overview describes a LLM-powered autonomous agent system that incorporates planning
      and self-reflection components. \\n\\n1. **Planning**: The system employs task
      decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
      to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step
      reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths at each step using search
      algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an external classical planner using
      Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2.
      **Self-Reflection**: This component allows agents to iteratively improve by
      analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting, enabling
      agents to interact with their environment while generating reasoning traces.
      Reflexion enhances this by incorporating dynamic memory and a reward model to
      assess the efficiency of actions and correct mistakes. It uses heuristics to
      identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations, and integrates reflections
      from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall, the system aims
      to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks through structured
      planning and self-improvement mechanisms.\",\"The experiments on AlfWorld Env
      and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination is a more prevalent failure than inefficient
      planning. The Chain of Hindsight (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing
      a sequence of past outputs with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect
      and improve. CoH employs supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to
      prevent overfitting and incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting.
      The training dataset combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning,
      models show incremental improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation
      (AD) applies a similar concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of
      learning trajectories to inform future actions, leading to better performance
      than traditional methods. AD demonstrates effective in-context reinforcement
      learning, achieving results close to online RL methods while learning faster
      than other baselines.\",\"The text discusses the comparison of various reinforcement
      learning (RL) methods, including AD, ED, source policy, and RL^2, in environments
      that require memory and exploration, with a focus on binary rewards. It highlights
      the types of memory in human brains: sensory memory (short-lived impressions
      of sensory information), short-term memory (limited capacity for current awareness),
      and long-term memory (unlimited storage for facts and experiences). The categorization
      of human memory is mapped to machine learning concepts, where sensory memory
      corresponds to learning embeddings, short-term memory relates to in-context
      learning, and long-term memory is likened to external vector stores for fast
      retrieval. The text also introduces Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) as a
      method to enhance retrieval speed from external memory, utilizing approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms for efficient data access.\",\"The text discusses
      various algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search, each with unique
      methodologies:\\n\\n1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**: A hashing function
      that maps similar items to the same buckets with high probability, using fewer
      buckets than inputs.\\n\\n2. **ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**:
      Utilizes random projection trees to split input space and store data points
      in leaves, mimicking a hashing function for scalable searches.\\n\\n3. **HNSW
      (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Builds hierarchical small-world graphs
      to facilitate efficient searches by navigating through layers, starting from
      a random node in the top layer.\\n\\n4. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**:
      Assumes Gaussian distribution in high-dimensional space, using vector quantization
      to cluster data points and refine searches within those clusters.\\n\\n5. **ScaNN
      (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)**: Innovates with anisotropic vector quantization
      to ensure that the quantized representation closely resembles the original distance
      metrics.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the importance of tool use in enhancing
      the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the role of external
      tools in extending their functionality.\",\"The text discusses various advancements
      in neuro-symbolic architectures for autonomous agents, particularly focusing
      on MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language) systems, which utilize a
      combination of expert modules and a general-purpose language model (LLM) to
      route inquiries effectively. Experiments revealed challenges in LLMs extracting
      arguments for verbal math problems compared to explicit ones, emphasizing the
      importance of knowing when and how to use external symbolic tools. Other frameworks
      like TALM and Toolformer enhance LLMs' capabilities to utilize external tool
      APIs, while ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API function calling exemplify practical
      applications. HuggingGPT is introduced as a framework that employs ChatGPT for
      task planning, involving four stages: task planning, model selection, task execution,
      and logging results. The system is designed to parse user requests into manageable
      tasks and select appropriate models for execution.\",\"The AI assistant processes
      user input by following a structured workflow: User Input, Task Planning, Model
      Selection, and Task Execution. It first provides a direct response to the user's
      request, then details the task process and shares analysis and inference results,
      including any relevant file paths.\\n\\nTo enhance real-world applications of
      HuggingGPT, several challenges must be addressed, including improving efficiency,
      managing long context windows for complex tasks, and stabilizing output quality.
      The API-Bank benchmark evaluates tool-augmented LLMs through 53 APIs and 264
      annotated dialogues, assessing their decision-making capabilities at three levels:
      calling APIs, retrieving the right APIs, and planning multiple API calls for
      complex requests.\\n\\nCase studies like ChemCrow demonstrate the effectiveness
      of LLMs augmented with expert tools for scientific tasks, revealing that while
      LLMs may perform similarly in evaluations, expert assessments show significant
      advantages for specialized tools. This highlights the limitations of LLMs in
      self-evaluating their performance in expert domains.\",\"The text discusses
      a project focused on anticancer drug discovery, where a target was selected,
      a scaffold was requested, and a compound was synthesized. The project also addressed
      risks related to illicit drugs and bioweapons, leading to a test set of known
      chemical weapon agents. Out of 11 synthesis requests, 4 were accepted, while
      7 were rejected, primarily after web searches. \\n\\nAdditionally, it describes
      the Generative Agents Simulation, where 25 virtual characters interact in a
      sandbox environment, utilizing a combination of long-term memory, planning,
      and reflection mechanisms to simulate human behavior. The architecture allows
      for emergent social behaviors, such as information diffusion and event coordination.

      independently using a natural language interface, with specific goals and constraints,
      highlighting its potential and reliability issues.\",\"The provided commands
      outline a set of functionalities for managing tasks, including searching the

      code, and generating images or tweets. Resources available include internet
      access, memory management, and GPT-3.5 agents for task delegation. Performance
      evaluation emphasizes continuous self-assessment, efficiency in task execution,
      and strategic reflection to optimize actions. The system is trained on data

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks
      down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling
      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism
      and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for
      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"Fig. 1. Overview of
      a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt,
      each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$
      is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback
      tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$
      The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form
      of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq
      i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned
      on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better
      output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple
      rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting,
      CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5.
      After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs
      with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD)
      works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any
      algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a
      neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data
      is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task.
      At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence
      of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy
      is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length,
      so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic
      contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL
      algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn
      comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior
      cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy
      (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al.
      2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context
      RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and
      learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training
      history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"Fig.

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes
      of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,
      retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in
      human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory,
      providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,
      auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically
      only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual),
      echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory
      (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of
      and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.
      Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller
      1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts
      and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\",\"LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are
      mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets
      is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\",\"Fig. 10. A picture
      of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.
      While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with
      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201CModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201D, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201Cexpert\u201D modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201CExternal APIs\u201D section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\",
      task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text,
      \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\"
      field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that
      the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated
      text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task
      MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There
      is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user
      input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases
      for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{
      Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned
      resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes
      the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice
      question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the
      limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven
      the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select
      a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant
      merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be
      in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail
      reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{
      Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution:
      Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\",\"With
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an
      API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase
      Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested
      to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\",\"inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected
      a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed
      the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test
      set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to
      synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis
      solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure.
      7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after
      a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents

      where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living
      and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents
      create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe
      design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection
      mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well
      as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory
      module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019

      inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency:
      recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core
      memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current
      situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher
      level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They
      are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different
      from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations
      and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
      Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate
      the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is
      essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\nFig.

      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept

      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\",\"Finite context length: The restricted context
      capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited

      article \\\"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\\" by Lilian Weng discusses the concept
      of using large language models (LLMs) as the core controller for autonomous
      agents. It outlines a system overview that includes three main components: planning,
      memory, and tool use. \\n\\n1. **Planning** involves task decomposition into
      smaller subgoals and self-reflection to improve future actions.\\n2. **Memory**
      is categorized into short-term (in-context learning) and long-term (retaining
      information using external storage).\\n3. **Tool Use** allows agents to access
      external APIs for additional information and capabilities beyond their pre-trained
      knowledge.\\n\\nThe article highlights various proof-of-concept examples, such
      as AutoGPT and BabyAGI, showcasing the potential of LLMs as general problem
      solvers. It also addresses the challenges faced in building these agents.\",\"The
      overview describes a LLM-powered autonomous agent system that incorporates planning
      and self-reflection components. \\n\\n1. **Planning**: The system employs task
      decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
      to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step
      reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths at each step using search
      algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an external classical planner using
      Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2.
      **Self-Reflection**: This component allows agents to iteratively improve by
      analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting, enabling
      agents to interact with their environment while generating reasoning traces.
      Reflexion enhances this by incorporating dynamic memory and a reward model to
      assess the efficiency of actions and correct mistakes. It uses heuristics to
      identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations, and integrates reflections
      from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall, the system aims
      to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks through structured
      planning and self-improvement mechanisms.\",\"The experiments on AlfWorld Env
      and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination is a more prevalent failure than inefficient
      planning. The Chain of Hindsight (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing
      a sequence of past outputs with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect
      and improve. CoH employs supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to
      prevent overfitting and incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting.
      The training dataset combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning,
      models show incremental improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation
      (AD) applies a similar concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of
      learning trajectories to inform future actions, leading to better performance
      than traditional methods. AD demonstrates effective in-context reinforcement
      learning, achieving results close to online RL methods while learning faster
      than other baselines.\",\"The text discusses the comparison of various reinforcement
      learning (RL) methods, including AD, ED, source policy, and RL^2, in environments
      that require memory and exploration, with a focus on binary rewards. It highlights
      the types of memory in human brains: sensory memory (short-lived impressions
      of sensory information), short-term memory (limited capacity for current awareness),
      and long-term memory (unlimited storage for facts and experiences). The categorization
      of human memory is mapped to machine learning concepts, where sensory memory
      corresponds to learning embeddings, short-term memory relates to in-context
      learning, and long-term memory is likened to external vector stores for fast

      agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept.
      Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI,
      serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating
      well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful
      general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous
      agent system, LLM functions as the agent\u2019s brain, complemented by several
      key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks
      down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling
      of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism
      and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for
      future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term
      memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering)
      as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This
      provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information
      over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast
      retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for
      extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change
      after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability,
      access to proprietary information sources and more.\",\"Fig. 1. Overview of
      a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated
      task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan
      ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become
      a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks.
      The model is instructed to \u201Cthink step by step\u201D to utilize more test-time
      computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms
      big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation
      of the model\u2019s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends
      CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes
      the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per
      step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first
      search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier
      (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM
      with simple prompting like \\\"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\\\", \\\"What are the subgoals
      for achieving XYZ?\\\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \\\"Write
      a story outline.\\\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother
      quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external
      classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning
      Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the
      planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into \u201CProblem
      PDDL\u201D, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based
      on an existing \u201CDomain PDDL\u201D, and finally (3) translates the PDDL
      plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced
      to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a
      suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other
      domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows
      autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and
      correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where
      trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning
      and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific
      discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact
      with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting
      LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template
      incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought:
      ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.
      \ Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA,
      FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source:
      Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making
      tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: \u2026 step
      is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents
      with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills.
      Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple
      binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific
      action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After
      each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide
      to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection
      results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory
      is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient
      planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination
      is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that
      lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created
      by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory,
      ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are
      added into the agent\u2019s working memory, up to three, to be used as context
      for querying LLM.\",\"Fig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination
      is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source:
      Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages
      the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence
      of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection
      of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt,
      each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$
      is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback
      tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$
      The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form
      of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq
      i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned
      on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better
      output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple
      rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting,
      CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training
      dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words
      in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe
      training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons,
      summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5.
      After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs
      with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe
      idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context
      and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm
      Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode
      trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated
      in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with
      the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better,
      AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we
      should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous
      trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific
      policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD)
      works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any
      algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a
      neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data
      is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task.
      At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence
      of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy
      is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length,
      so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic
      contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL
      algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn
      comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior
      cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy
      (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al.
      2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context
      RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and
      learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training
      history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\",\"Fig.

      for helping me draft this section. I\u2019ve learned a lot about the human brain
      and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes
      of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store,
      retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in
      human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory,
      providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual,
      auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically
      only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual),
      echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory
      (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of
      and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning.
      Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller
      1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term
      memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few
      days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two
      subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts
      and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including
      episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit
      / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills
      and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing
      on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly
      consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations
      for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory
      as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite
      context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector
      store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum
      Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction
      of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation
      of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product
      search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN)\u200B algorithm to return approximately top k nearest
      neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple
      common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\",\"LSH (Locality-Sensitive
      Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are
      mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets
      is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors
      Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary
      trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space
      into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently
      and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search
      happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest
      to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD
      tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It
      is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached
      by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. \u201Csix degrees of
      separation\u201D feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers
      of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data
      points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing
      a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards
      the target. When it can\u2019t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer,
      until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially
      cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers
      refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates
      on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow
      a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points.
      FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters
      and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster
      candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster
      with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation
      in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$
      to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$
      is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible,
      instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

      Three: Tool Use#\\nTool use is a remarkable and distinguishing characteristic
      of human beings. We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things
      that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external
      tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\",\"Fig. 10. A picture
      of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water.
      While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with
      humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short
      for \u201CModular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language\u201D, is a neuro-symbolic
      architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection
      of \u201Cexpert\u201D modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router
      to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be
      neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency
      converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call
      a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that
      it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems
      because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments
      for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic
      tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial,
      determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models;
      Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn
      to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly
      added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more
      details in the \u201CExternal APIs\u201D section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT
      Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented
      with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can
      be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function
      calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the
      task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to
      the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig.
      11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe
      system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and
      parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated
      with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot
      examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe
      AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\\\"task\\\": task, \\\"id\\\",
      task_id, \\\"dep\\\": dependency_task_ids, \\\"args\\\": {\\\"text\\\": text,
      \\\"image\\\": URL, \\\"audio\\\": URL, \\\"video\\\": URL}}]. The \\\"dep\\\"
      field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that
      the current task relies on. A special tag \\\"-task_id\\\" refers to the generated
      text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task
      MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There
      is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user
      input can't be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases
      for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{
      Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned
      resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes
      the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice
      question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the
      limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven
      the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select
      a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant
      merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be
      in a strict JSON format: \\\"id\\\": \\\"id\\\", \\\"reason\\\": \\\"your detail
      reason for the choice\\\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{
      Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution:
      Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\",\"With
      the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the
      process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User
      Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }},
      Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user's request
      in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis
      and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results
      contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response
      generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results
      to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need
      to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds
      and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a
      long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability
      improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al.
      2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs.
      It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow,
      and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs
      is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart
      home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication
      workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access
      to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding
      documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an
      API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow,
      LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how
      accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify
      the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the
      API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse
      based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results
      are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent\u2019s tool use capabilities
      at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an
      API\u2019s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given
      API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines
      the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs
      that may solve the user\u2019s requirement and learn how to use them by reading
      documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and
      call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant
      for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase
      Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific
      example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish
      tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow,
      implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct
      and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe
      LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and
      details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a
      user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests
      the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne
      interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that
      GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts
      oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed
      that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential
      problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires
      deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and
      thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023)
      also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous
      design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent
      can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call
      robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested
      to \\\"develop a novel anticancer drug\\\", the model came up with the following
      reasoning steps:\",\"inquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected
      a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound
      was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed
      the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test
      set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to
      synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis
      solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure.
      7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after
      a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents
      Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment
      where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living
      and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents
      create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe
      design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection
      mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well
      as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory
      module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents\u2019
      experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event
      directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new
      natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to
      inform the agent\u2019s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency:
      recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core
      memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current
      situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher
      level inferences over time and guides the agent\u2019s future behavior. They
      are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different
      from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations
      and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements.
      Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate
      the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is
      essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt
      template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X's plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships
      between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration
      for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\nFig.
      13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis
      fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion,
      relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and
      coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept
      Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting
      up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of
      reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a
      cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere

      going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to
      see a couple common limitations:\",\"Finite context length: The restricted context
      capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions,
      API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this
      limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn
      from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows.
      Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge
      pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges
      in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history
      and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle
      to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared
      to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language
      interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between
      LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability
      of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally
      exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently,
      much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited

      article \\\"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents\\\" by Lilian Weng discusses the concept
      of using large language models (LLMs) as the core controller for autonomous
      agents. It outlines a system overview that includes three main components: planning,
      memory, and tool use. \\n\\n1. **Planning** involves task decomposition into
      smaller subgoals and self-reflection to improve future actions.\\n2. **Memory**
      is categorized into short-term (in-context learning) and long-term (retaining
      information using external storage).\\n3. **Tool Use** allows agents to access
      external APIs for additional information and capabilities beyond their pre-trained
      knowledge.\\n\\nThe article highlights various proof-of-concept examples, such
      as AutoGPT and BabyAGI, showcasing the potential of LLMs as general problem
      solvers. It also addresses the challenges faced in building these agents.\",\"The
      overview describes a LLM-powered autonomous agent system that incorporates planning
      and self-reflection components. \\n\\n1. **Planning**: The system employs task
      decomposition techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
      to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. CoT encourages step-by-step
      reasoning, while ToT explores multiple reasoning paths at each step using search
      algorithms. Additionally, LLM+P integrates an external classical planner using
      Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) for long-horizon planning.\\n\\n2.
      **Self-Reflection**: This component allows agents to iteratively improve by
      analyzing past actions. The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting, enabling
      agents to interact with their environment while generating reasoning traces.
      Reflexion enhances this by incorporating dynamic memory and a reward model to
      assess the efficiency of actions and correct mistakes. It uses heuristics to
      identify inefficient trajectories and hallucinations, and integrates reflections
      from past experiences to guide future actions.\\n\\nOverall, the system aims
      to enhance the performance of autonomous agents in complex tasks through structured
      planning and self-improvement mechanisms.\",\"The experiments on AlfWorld Env
      and HotpotQA reveal that hallucination is a more prevalent failure than inefficient
      planning. The Chain of Hindsight (CoH) method enhances model outputs by providing
      a sequence of past outputs with human feedback, allowing the model to self-reflect
      and improve. CoH employs supervised fine-tuning with a regularization term to
      prevent overfitting and incorporates random masking of tokens to avoid shortcutting.
      The training dataset combines various human feedback sources. After fine-tuning,
      models show incremental improvement in output quality. Algorithm Distillation
      (AD) applies a similar concept in reinforcement learning, using a history of
      learning trajectories to inform future actions, leading to better performance
      than traditional methods. AD demonstrates effective in-context reinforcement
      learning, achieving results close to online RL methods while learning faster
      than other baselines.\",\"The text discusses the comparison of various reinforcement
      learning (RL) methods, including AD, ED, source policy, and RL^2, in environments
      that require memory and exploration, with a focus on binary rewards. It highlights
      the types of memory in human brains: sensory memory (short-lived impressions
      of sensory information), short-term memory (limited capacity for current awareness),
      and long-term memory (unlimited storage for facts and experiences). The categorization
      of human memory is mapped to machine learning concepts, where sensory memory
      corresponds to learning embeddings, short-term memory relates to in-context
      learning, and long-term memory is likened to external vector stores for fast
      retrieval. The text also introduces Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) as a
      method to enhance retrieval speed from external memory, utilizing approximate
      nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms for efficient data access.\",\"The text discusses
      various algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search, each with unique
      methodologies:\\n\\n1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**: A hashing function
      that maps similar items to the same buckets with high probability, using fewer
      buckets than inputs.\\n\\n2. **ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah)**:
      Utilizes random projection trees to split input space and store data points
      in leaves, mimicking a hashing function for scalable searches.\\n\\n3. **HNSW
      (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Builds hierarchical small-world graphs
      to facilitate efficient searches by navigating through layers, starting from
      a random node in the top layer.\\n\\n4. **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**:
      Assumes Gaussian distribution in high-dimensional space, using vector quantization
      to cluster data points and refine searches within those clusters.\\n\\n5. **ScaNN
      (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)**: Innovates with anisotropic vector quantization
      to ensure that the quantized representation closely resembles the original distance
      metrics.\\n\\nThe text also highlights the importance of tool use in enhancing
      the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), emphasizing the role of external
      tools in extending their functionality.\",\"The text discusses various advancements
      in neuro-symbolic architectures for autonomous agents, particularly focusing
      on MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language) systems, which utilize a
      combination of expert modules and a general-purpose language model (LLM) to
      route inquiries effectively. Experiments revealed challenges in LLMs extracting
      arguments for verbal math problems compared to explicit ones, emphasizing the
      importance of knowing when and how to use external symbolic tools. Other frameworks
      like TALM and Toolformer enhance LLMs' capabilities to utilize external tool
      APIs, while ChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API function calling exemplify practical
      applications. HuggingGPT is introduced as a framework that employs ChatGPT for
      task planning, involving four stages: task planning, model selection, task execution,
      and logging results. The system is designed to parse user requests into manageable
      tasks and select appropriate models for execution.\",\"The AI assistant processes
      user input by following a structured workflow: User Input, Task Planning, Model
      Selection, and Task Execution. It first provides a direct response to the user's
      request, then details the task process and shares analysis and inference results,
      including any relevant file paths.\\n\\nTo enhance real-world applications of
      HuggingGPT, several challenges must be addressed, including improving efficiency,
      managing long context windows for complex tasks, and stabilizing output quality.
      The API-Bank benchmark evaluates tool-augmented LLMs through 53 APIs and 264
      annotated dialogues, assessing their decision-making capabilities at three levels:
      calling APIs, retrieving the right APIs, and planning multiple API calls for
      complex requests.\\n\\nCase studies like ChemCrow demonstrate the effectiveness
      of LLMs augmented with expert tools for scientific tasks, revealing that while
      LLMs may perform similarly in evaluations, expert assessments show significant
      advantages for specialized tools. This highlights the limitations of LLMs in
      self-evaluating their performance in expert domains.\",\"The text discusses
      a project focused on anticancer drug discovery, where a target was selected,
      a scaffold was requested, and a compound was synthesized. The project also addressed
      risks related to illicit drugs and bioweapons, leading to a test set of known
      chemical weapon agents. Out of 11 synthesis requests, 4 were accepted, while
      7 were rejected, primarily after web searches. \\n\\nAdditionally, it describes
      the Generative Agents Simulation, where 25 virtual characters interact in a
      sandbox environment, utilizing a combination of long-term memory, planning,
      and reflection mechanisms to simulate human behavior. The architecture allows
      for emergent social behaviors, such as information diffusion and event coordination.
