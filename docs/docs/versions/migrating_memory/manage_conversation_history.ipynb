    "| Memory Type                          | Description                                                                                                                                          |\n",

    "| `ConversationBufferMemory`            | A basic memory implementation that simply stores the conversation history.                                                                            |\n",
    "| `ConversationStringBufferMemory`      | A special case of `ConversationBufferMemory` designed for LLMs and no longer relevant.                                                                |\n",
    "| `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`      | Keeps the last `n` turns of the conversation. Drops the oldest turn when the buffer is full.                                                          |\n",
    "| `ConversationTokenBufferMemory`       | Keeps only the most recent messages in the conversation under the constraint that the total number of tokens in the conversation does not exceed a certain limit. |\n",
    "| `ConversationSummaryMemory`           | Continually summarizes the conversation history. The summary is updated after each conversation turn. The abstraction returns the summary of the conversation history. |\n",
    "| `ConversationSummaryBufferMemory`     | Provides a running summary of the conversation together with the most recent messages in the conversation under the constraint that the total number of tokens in the conversation does not exceed a certain limit. |\n",
    "| `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory`          | Stores the conversation history in a vector store and retrieves the most relevant parts of past conversation based on the input.                        |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of managing conversation history is to store and retrieve it in a way that maximizes its usefulness for a chat model. This often requires trimming or summarizing the conversation to retain the most relevant details while ensuring it fits within the model's context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain v0.0.x offered several methods for managing conversation history. While these memory abstractions were helpful, they had limitations that made them less effective for real-world conversational AI. Many were developed before the advent of chat models, making them poorly suited for such applications. Additionally, they lacked robust solutions for handling multi-user, multi-conversation scenariosâ€”an essential requirement for practical conversational AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods for handling conversation history using existing modern primitives are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using [LangGraph persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/persistence/) along with appropriate processing of the message history\n",
    "2. Using LCEL with [RunnableWithMessageHistory](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.history.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html) combined with appropriate processing of the message history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most users will find [LangGraph persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/persistence/) both easier to use and easier to configure than the equivalent LCEL, especially for more complex use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advantages to using LangGraph persistence:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangGraph persistence is much more powerful than simple chat memory -- it lets you save and resume complex state at any time for error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel interactions, and more.\n",
    "- LangGraph persistence is built to support multi user, multi thread scenarios and will work well in production settings.\n",
    "- Both LLMs and chat models are fully supported.\n",
    "- Users have granular control over how memory is updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ":::hint\n",
