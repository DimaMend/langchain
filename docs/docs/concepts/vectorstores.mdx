# Vector stores

<span data-heading-keywords="vector,vectorstore,vectorstores,vector store,vector stores"></span>

One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding vectors,
and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are 'most similar' to the embedded query.
A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you.

Most vector stores can also store metadata about embedded vectors and support filtering on that metadata before
similarity search, allowing you more control over returned documents.

Vector stores can be converted to the retriever interface by doing:

```python
vectorstore = MyVectorStore()
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
```

For specifics on how to use vector stores, see the [relevant how-to guides here](/docs/how_to/#vector-stores).

To add -- 

In the case of vectorstores, it is common to have unstructured data (e.g., raw text documents) and structured data (e.g., metadata associated with the documents). 

This allows for querying in two different ways:

1. **Semantic search**: Query the unstructured data directly, often using via embedding or keyword similarity.
2. **Metadata search**: Apply structured query to the metadata, filering specific documents.
