## Tokens

The unit that most model providers use to measure input and output is via a unit called a **token**.
Tokens are the basic units that language models read and generate when processing or producing text.
The exact definition of a token can vary depending on the specific way the model was trained -
for instance, in English, a token could be a single word like "apple", or a part of a word like "app".

When you send a model a prompt, the words and characters in the prompt are encoded into tokens using a **tokenizer**.
The model then streams back generated output tokens, which the tokenizer decodes into human-readable text.
The below example shows how OpenAI models tokenize `LangChain is cool!`:

You can see that it gets split into 5 different tokens, and that the boundaries between tokens are not exactly the same as word boundaries.

The reason language models use tokens rather than something more immediately intuitive like "characters"
has to do with how they process and understand text. At a high-level, language models iteratively predict their next generated output based on
the initial input and their previous generations. Training the model using tokens language models to handle linguistic
units (like words or subwords) that carry meaning, rather than individual characters, which makes it easier for the model
to learn and understand the structure of the language, including grammar and context.
Furthermore, using tokens can also improve efficiency, since the model processes fewer units of text compared to character-level processing.
