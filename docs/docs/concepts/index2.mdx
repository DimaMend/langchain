# Conceptual guide

## Overview

In this guide, you'll find explanations of the key concepts, providing a deeper understanding of core principles.

We recommend that you go through at least one of the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) before diving into the conceptual guide. This will help you understand the context and practical applications of the concepts discussed here.

The conceptual guide will not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation details â€” those are found in the [How-To Guides](/docs/how_to/) and [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) sections. For detailed reference material, please visit the [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/).
