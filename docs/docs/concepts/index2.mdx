# Conceptual guide

## Overview

In this guide, you'll find explanations of the key concepts, providing a deeper understanding of core principles.

We recommend that you go through at least one of the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) before diving into the conceptual guide. This will help you understand the context and practical applications of the concepts discussed here.

The conceptual guide will not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation details â€” those are found in the [How-To Guides](/docs/how_to/) and [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) sections. For detailed reference material, please visit the [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/).


## Table of Contents

- [Why LangChain?](/docs/concepts/why_langchain): Why LangChain is the best choice for building AI applications.
- [Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture): Overview of how packages are organized in the LangChain ecosystem.
    Terms: `langchain`, `langchain-community`, `langchain-core`, `langserve`, `langgraph`, `partner packages`.
- [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models): Modern LLMs exposed via a chat interface which process sequences of messages as input and outputs a message.
    Terms: `ChatModel`, `LLM`, `Caching`, `rate limiting`, `context window`, `with_structured_output`, `bind_tools`
- [Messages](/docs/concepts/messages): Messages are the unit of communication in modern LLMs. They are used to represent input and output of a chat model, as well as any additional context or metadata that may be associated with the conversation.
    Terms: `Role`, `content`, `HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ToolMessage`, `AIMessageChunk`, `tool_call`, `OpenAI format`, `Remove Message`
- [Chat History](/docs/concepts/chat_history): Chat history is a record of the conversation between the user and the chat model. It is used to maintain context and state throughout the conversation. The chat history is sequence of [messages](/docs/concepts/messages), each of which is associated with a specific [role](/docs/concepts/messages#role), such as "user", "assistant", "system", or "tool".
