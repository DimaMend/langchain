# Architecture

The LangChain framework consists of a number of packages.

## Langchain-core

This package contains base abstractions of different components and ways to compose them together.
The interfaces for core components like chat models, vector stores, tools, and more are defined here.
No third-party integrations are defined here.
The langchain-core dependencies are very minimal.

## Langchain

The main `langchain` package contains chains and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
These are NOT third-party integrations.
All chains and retrieval strategies here are NOT specific to any one integration, but rather generic across all integrations.

## Integration packages

Popular integrations live in their own packages (e.g. `langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`, etc.) so that they can be lightweight and properly versioned. For more information see:

* A list [integrations](/docs/integrations/providers/).
* The [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/) where you can find detailed information about each integration package.

## Langchain-community

This package contains the long tail of third-party integrations that are maintained by the LangChain community.
This contains integrations for various components (LLMs, vector stores, retrievers, etc.).
All dependencies in this package are optional to keep the package as lightweight as possible.

## Langgraph

`langgraph` is an extension of `langchain` aimed at building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.

LangGraph exposes high level interfaces for creating common types of agents, as well as a low-level API for composing custom flows.

## Langserve

A package to deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs. Makes it easy to get a production ready API up and running.

:::important
LangServe is designed to primarily deploy simple Runnables and work with well-known primitives in langchain-core.

If you need a deployment option for LangGraph, you should instead be looking at LangGraph Cloud (beta) which will be better suited for deploying LangGraph applications.

## Langsmith

A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.
