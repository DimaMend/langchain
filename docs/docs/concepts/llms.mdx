# LLMs

:::caution
Pure text-in/text-out LLMs tend to be older or lower-level. Many new popular models are best used as [chat completion models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models),
even for non-chat use cases.

You are probably looking for [the section above instead](/docs/concepts/#chat-models).

Available LLM Integrations: [LangChain LLM Integrations](/docs/integrations/llms/)

Language models that takes a string as input and returns a string.

These are traditionally older models (newer models generally are [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models), see above).

Although the underlying models are string in, string out, the LangChain wrappers also allow these models to take messages as input.
This gives them the same interface as [Chat Models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models).
When messages are passed in as input, they will be formatted into a string under the hood before being passed to the underlying model.

LangChain does not host any LLMs, rather we rely on third party integrations.

For specifics on how to use LLMs, see the [how-to guides](/docs/how_to/#llms).
