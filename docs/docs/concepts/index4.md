# Conceptual Guide

## Overview

In this guide, you'll find explanations of the key concepts, providing a deeper understanding of core principles.

We recommend that you go through at least one of the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) before diving into the conceptual guide. This will help you understand the context and practical applications of the concepts discussed here.

The conceptual guide will not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation details â€” those are found in the [How-To Guides](/docs/how_to/) and [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) sections. For detailed reference material, please visit the [API Reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/).

## Concepts

- **[Why LangChain?](/docs/concepts/why_langchain)**: Why LangChain is the best choice for building AI applications.

- **[Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture)**: Overview of how packages are organized in the LangChain ecosystem.

- **[Chat Models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)**: Modern LLMs exposed via a chat interface which process sequences of messages as input and output a message.

- **[Messages](/docs/concepts/messages)**: Messages are the unit of communication in modern LLMs, used to represent input and output of a chat model, as well as any additional context or metadata that may be associated with the conversation.

- **[Chat History](/docs/concepts/chat_history)**: Chat history is a record of the conversation between the user and the chat model, used to maintain context and state throughout the conversation.

- **[Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)**: The **tool** abstraction in LangChain associates a Python **function** with a **schema** defining the function's **name**, **description**, and **input**.

- **[Tool Calling](/docs/concepts/tool_calling)**: Tool calling is the process of invoking a tool from a chat model.

- **[Structured Output](/docs/concepts/structured_outputs)**: A technique to make the chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON and matching a specific schema.

- **[Multimodality](/docs/concepts/multimodality)**: The ability to work with data that comes in different forms, such as text, audio, images, and video.

- **[Tokens](/docs/concepts/tokens)**: Modern large language models (LLMs) are typically based on a transformer architecture that processes a sequence of units known as tokens.

- **[Runnable Interface](/docs/concepts/runnables)**: The Runnable interface is foundational for working with LangChain components.

- **[LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)**: A declarative approach to building new Runnables from existing Runnables.

- **[Retrieval](/docs/concepts/retrieval)**

- **[Text Splitters](/docs/concepts/text_splitters)**

- **[Embedding Models](/docs/concepts/embedding_models)**: Embedding models are models that can represent data in a vector space.

- **[VectorStores](/docs/concepts/vectorstores)**: A datastore that can store embeddings and associated data and supports efficient vector search.

- **[Retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers)**: A retriever is a component that retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to a query.

- **[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/docs/concepts/rag)**: A powerful technique that enhances language models by combining them with external knowledge bases.

- **[Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)**
