    "> [AskNews](https://asknews.app) infuses any LLM with the latest global news (or historical news), using a single natural language query. Specifically, AskNews is enriching over 300k articles per day by translating, summarizing, extracting entities, and indexing them into hot and cold vector databases. AskNews puts these vector databases on a low-latency endpoint for you. When you query AskNews, you get back a prompt-optimized string that contains all the most pertinent enrichments (e.g. entities, classifications, translation, summarization). This means that you do not need to manage your own news RAG, and you do not need to worry about how to properly convey news information in a condensed way to your LLM.\n",
    "> AskNews is also committed to transparency, which is why our coverage is monitored and diversified across hundreds of countries, 13 languages, and 50 thousand sources. If you'd like to track our source coverage, you can visit our [transparency dashboard](https://asknews.app/en/transparency).\n",

The firm believes that the Fed will attempt to cut rates twice before the end of the year, but the probability of holding rates steady is rising. As a result, Wells Fargo is taking a defensive approach in its positioning, recommending that fixed-income investors favor short-term fixed income and be neutral on intermediate and long-term investments. The firm also expects the yield curve to continue to flatten, and notes that events such as the Fed removing rate cut expectations, inflation increasing, or the US fiscal situation deteriorating could push 10-year Treasury yields towards 5%.\\nsource: Seeking Alpha\\npublished: May 12 2024 13:30\\nOrganization: Federal Reserve, Fed, Wells Fargo\\nProduct: 10-year Treasury, 2-year Treasury, short-term fixed income\\nDate: end of the year\\nEvent: US fiscal situation\\nclassification: Business\\nsentiment: 0\\n</doc>\\n\\n<doc>\\n[2]:\\ntitle: US Stock Market Declines Amid High Interest Rates\\nsummary: The US stock market has experienced a significant decline in recent days, with the S&P 500 index falling 9.94 points or 0.2% to 4320.06. The decline was attributed to interest rates, which are expected to remain high for a longer period. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 4.44%, the highest level since 2007, which has a negative impact on stock prices. The high interest rates have also affected the technology sector, with companies such as Intel and Microsoft experiencing declines. The auto sector is also experiencing fluctuations, with General Motors and Ford experiencing declines. The labor market is also facing challenges, with workers demanding higher wages and benefits, which could lead to increased inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep interest rates high for a longer period, which could have a negative impact on the stock market.
