    "This notebook covers how to get started with the `VDMS` vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Intel's [Visual Data Management System (VDMS)](https://github.com/IntelLabs/vdms) is a storage solution for efficient access of big-”visual”-data that aims to achieve cloud scale by searching for relevant visual data via visual metadata stored as a graph and enabling machine friendly enhancements to visual data for faster access. VDMS is licensed under MIT. For more information on `VDMS`, visit [this page](https://github.com/IntelLabs/vdms/wiki), and find the LangChain API reference [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.vdms.VDMS.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "VDMS supports:\n",
    "* K nearest neighbor search\n",
    "* Euclidean distance (L2) and inner product (IP)\n",
    "* Libraries for indexing and computing distances: FaissFlat (Default), FaissHNSWFlat, FaissIVFFlat, Flinng, TileDBDense, TileDBSparse\n",
    "* Embeddings for text, images, and video\n",
    "* Vector and metadata searches\n",
    "\n",
    "VDMS has server and client components. To setup the server, see the [installation instructions](https://github.com/IntelLabs/vdms/blob/master/INSTALL.md) or use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/intellabs/vdms).\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use VDMS as a vector store using the docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To access `VDMS` vector store, you'll need to install the `langchain-community` package and the [VDMS Client Python Module](https://pypi.org/project/vdms/)."
