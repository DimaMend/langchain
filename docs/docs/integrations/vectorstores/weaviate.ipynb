    "# Weaviate\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers how to get started with the Weaviate vector store in LangChain, using the `langchain-weaviate` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) is an open-source vector database. It allows you to store data objects and vector embeddings from your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this integration, you need to have a running Weaviate database instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum versions\n",
    "\n",
    "This module requires Weaviate `1.23.7` or higher. However, we recommend you use the latest version of Weaviate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connecting to Weaviate\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we assume that you have a local instance of Weaviate running on `http://localhost:8080` and port 50051 open for [gRPC traffic](https://weaviate.io/blog/grpc-performance-improvements). So, we will connect to Weaviate with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "weaviate_client = weaviate.connect_to_local()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other deployment options\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate can be [deployed in many different ways](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/starter-guides/which-weaviate) such as using [Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS)](https://console.weaviate.cloud), [Docker](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/kubernetes). \n",
    "\n",
    "If your Weaviate instance is deployed in another way, [read more here](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#instantiate-a-client) about different ways to connect to Weaviate. You can use different [helper functions](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#python-client-v4-helper-functions) or [create a custom instance](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#python-client-v4-explicit-connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that you require a `v4` client API, which will create a `weaviate.WeaviateClient` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Weaviate instances, such as those running on WCS, have authentication enabled, such as API key and/or username+password authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the [client authentication guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python#authentication) for more information, as well as the [in-depth authentication configuration page](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/authentication)."
