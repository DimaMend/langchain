Ghouls have powers including enhanced strength, speed, endurance and regenerative abilities—a regular ghoul produces 4–7 times more kinetic energy in their muscles than a normal human; they also have several times the RC cells, a cell that flows like blood and can become solid instantly. A ghoul\\'s skin is resistant to ordinary piercing weapons, and it has at least one special predatory organ called a Kagune (赫子), which it can manifest and use as a weapon during combat. Another distinctive trait of ghouls is that when they are excited or hungry, the color of their sclera in both eyes turns black and their irises red. This mutation is known as kakugan (赫眼, \"red eye\").\\nA half-ghoul can either be born naturally as a ghoul and a human\\'s offspring, or artificially created by transplanting some ghoul organs into a human. In both cases, a half-ghoul is usually much stronger than a pure-blood ghoul. In the case of a half-ghoul, only one of the eyes undergoes the \"red eye\" transformation. Natural born half-ghouls are very rare, and creating half-ghouls artificially initially has a low success rate. There is also the case of half-humans, hybrids of ghouls and humans that can feed like normal humans and lack a Kagune while possessing enhanced abilities, like increased reaction speeds, but shortened lifespans. Naturally born half-ghouls can also eat like normal humans or full ghouls.\\n\\n\\n=== Plot ===\\n\\nThe story follows 17-year-old Ken Kaneki, a student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro (his date who reveals herself as a ghoul and tries to eat him) when she gets hit by falling construction girders. He is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul. This was accomplished because some of Rize\\'s organs were transferred into his body, and now, like'),\n",

After the operation Kaneki develops ghoul-like tendencies and characteristics, and his rationality begins to wane. As one that now doesn't belong to humans or ghouls he struggles to keep his ghoul identity secret, always fighting against his ghoul side while trying to continue to live like a normal human. He later works as a waiter for Anteiku under Yoshimura's guidance. After his fight with a CCG investigator named Amon he gains the name Eye Patch (眼帯) because of his mask's design and becomes somewhat famous after a ghoul saw him defeating the investigator. He loves to read and is normally quiet and reserved but can also be calculating when fighting. He has a bad trait of easily trusting strangers which sometimes puts him in life-threatening situations. After being kidnapped by the ghoul run organization known as Aogiri Tree, he is mercilessly tortured by a sadistic ghoul named Yakumo Ōmori (Yamori), and later develops similar traits to his torturer. While being tortured he has hallucinations of Rize in which she mocks him about his mother, leading to him finally embracing his inner ghoul. In the manga at chapter 61, Kaneki's hair slowly changes color from black to white. In the anime, Tokyo ghoul, his hair changes instantly after eating Rize and accepting his ghoul side. He then goes on and eats his torturer, Yakumo Ōmori.  His view on strength changes and he goes on a power hungry path by cannibalizing other ghouls in order to get stronger. The continued cannibalization led him to become a half kakuja, where he develops a centipede shaped kagune and gains the alias Centipede (百足). After the incident at Kanō's Lab, Kaneki begins to regret this path and begins reflecting on his actions and motives.\\nAfter being defeated and captured by Arima, Ken loses his memories and is given the new identity of Haise Sasaki (佐々木 琲世, Sasaki Haise), member and ace of the Mado Squad, and mentor of the Quinx Squad, a special unit composed of artificial ghouls. Despite having a new identity, Haise still retains some traits from his former self, like the love for reading and the determination to protect his companions with his life. When pressured to the limit, Haise has glimpses of his former self and unlocks his powers as a ghoul, forcing the CCG to strike him with RC suppressors to calm him down. Haise usually has an internal conflict with his past self, fearing that one day he would lose his current life with all his new friends and personality, which intensifies as he obtains more information about his former life until the raid at the Tsukiyama Headquarters, when he finally regains his memories and accepts his identity as Kaneki, not only showing a ruthless demeanor when facing his enemies, but a cold attitude toward his current and former allies as well. Haise's achievements allow him to quickly climb among the CCG's ranks, being promoted to First Class after the raid at the human auction and receiving a special promotion to Associate Special Class after single-handedly driving away the One-Eyed Owl during the raid at the Tsukiyama Headquarters, becoming known as the Black Reaper (黒の死神, Kuro no Shinigami), until he betrays the CCG to help Tōka rescue Hinami from the Cochlea, releasing the other ghouls imprisoned there in the occasion. After Kaneki defeats Arima, he claims for himself the title of One-Eyed King (隻眼の王, Sekigan no Ō), who according to Eto, has the potential to break the current status quo between ghouls and humans.

      "**Answer**: Apify is a web scraping and automation platform that provides tools for extracting data from websites, automating workflows, and creating APIs for web data access. It allows users to easily create web scraping tasks, schedule them, and manage the extracted data. Apify also offers a marketplace where users can find pre-built web scraping actors for various websites and use them to extract data without needing to write custom code. \n",

      "**Answer**: The uncertainty principle, also known as Heisenberg's indeterminacy principle, is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. It states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known. In other words, the more accurately one property is measured, the less accurately the other property can be known. This principle was introduced in 1927 by German physicist Werner Heisenberg and is mathematically expressed in terms of the standard deviations of position and momentum. \n",

It was one of the most sacred Buddhist pilgrimage cities in the nation and was a large monastic center with magnificent structures and religious units. Abhayagiri Vihāra included the Abhayagiri Dagaba, which was an ancient stupa and a focal point of the complex. Additionally, it was a seat of the Northern Monastery and held the original custodian of the Tooth relic in Sri Lanka. The term \"Abhayagiri Vihāra\" refers not only to the complex of monastic buildings but also to a fraternity of Buddhist monks who maintained their own historical records and traditions. Founded in the 2nd century BC, it grew into an international institution by the 1st century AD and attracted scholars from distant locations. \n",
