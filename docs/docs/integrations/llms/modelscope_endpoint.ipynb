Below are examples of how you can sort an array using both the `sort()` method and the `sorted()` function.\\n\\n### Using the `sort()` Method\\nThe `sort()` method sorts the list in place and modifies the original list.\\n\\n```python\\n# Define the array\\narray = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\\n\\n# Sort the array in ascending order\\narray.sort()\\n\\n# Print the sorted array\\nprint(\"Sorted array (ascending):\", array)\\n\\n# Sort the array in descending order\\narray.sort(reverse=True)\\n\\n# Print the sorted array\\nprint(\"Sorted array (descending):\", array)\\n```\\n\\n### Using the `sorted()` Function\\nThe `sorted()` function returns a new list that is sorted, leaving the original list unchanged.\\n\\n```python\\n# Define the array\\narray = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\\n\\n# Get a new sorted array in ascending order\\nsorted_array_asc = sorted(array)\\n\\n# Print the sorted array\\nprint(\"Sorted array (ascending):\", sorted_array_asc)\\n\\n# Get a new sorted array in descending order\\nsorted_array_desc = sorted(array, reverse=True)\\n\\n# Print the sorted array\\nprint(\"Sorted array (descending):\", sorted_array_desc)\\n```\\n\\n### Custom Sorting\\nYou can also sort based on custom criteria using a key function.\\n\\n```python\\n# Define the array of tuples\\narray_of_tuples = [(1, \\'one\\'), (3, \\'three\\'), (2, \\'two\\')]\\n\\n# Sort the array of tuples based on the second element of each tuple\\nsorted_by_second_element = sorted(array_of_tuples, key=lambda x: x[1])\\n\\n# Print the sorted array\\nprint(\"Sorted array by second element:\", sorted_by_second_element)\\n```\\n\\nThese examples demonstrate how to sort arrays in Python using different methods.
