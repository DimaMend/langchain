    "## Overview\n",
    "ModelScope ([Home](https://www.modelscope.cn/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope)) is built upon the notion of “Model-as-a-Service” (MaaS). It seeks to bring together most advanced machine learning models from the AI community, and streamlines the process of leveraging AI models in real-world applications. The core ModelScope library open-sourced in this repository provides the interfaces and implementations that allow developers to perform model inference, training and evaluation.\n",

The `sort()` method sorts the list in place and returns `None`.\\n  \\n- **Bubble Sort**: This algorithm repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues this process until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.\\n\\nBoth methods will give you a sorted array, but using the built-in methods is generally preferred due to their efficiency and simplicity.'"
