# OceanBase

[OceanBase Database](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase) is a distributed relational database. 
It is developed entirely by Ant Group. The OceanBase Database is built on a common server cluster. 
Based on the Paxos protocol and its distributed structure, the OceanBase Database provides high availability and linear scalability.

OceanBase currently has the ability to store vectors. Users can easily perform the following operations with SQL:

- Create a table containing vector type fields;
- Create a vector index table based on the HNSW algorithm;
- Perform vector approximate nearest neighbor queries;
- ...

## Install dependencies

We use `pyobvector` to integrate OceanBase vector store into LangChain.
So it is necessary to install it with `pip install pyobvector` before starting.

## Setup OceanBase

We recommend using Docker to deploy OceanBase:

```shell
docker run --name=ob433 -e MODE=slim -p 2881:2881 -d oceanbase/oceanbase-ce:4.3.3.0-100000132024100711
```

## Wrappers

To import OceanBase vectorstore:
```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores.oceanbase import OceanBase
```

### Usage
