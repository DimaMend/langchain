# How to bootstrap a new integration package

This guide walks through the process of publishing a new LangChain integration 
package to PyPi.

Integration packages are just Python packages that can be installed with `pip install <your-package>`,
which contain classes that are compatible with LangChain's core interfaces.

In this guide, we will be using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for
dependency management and packaging, and you're welcome to use any other tools you prefer.

## **Prerequisites**

- [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) account

## Boostrapping a new Python package with Poetry

First, install Poetry:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Next, come up with a name for your package. For this guide, we'll use `langchain-parrot-link`.
You can confirm that the name is available on PyPi by searching for it on the [PyPi website](https://pypi.org/).

Next, create your new Python package with Poetry, and navigate into the new directory with `cd`:

```bash
poetry new langchain-parrot-link
cd langchain-parrot-link
```

Add main dependencies using Poetry, which will add them to your `pyproject.toml` file:

```bash
poetry add langchain-core
```

We will also add some `test` dependencies in a separate poetry dependency group. If
you are not using Poetry, we recommend adding these in a way that won't package them
with your published package, or just installing them separately when you run tests.

`langchain-tests` will provide the [standard tests](/docs/contributing/how_to/integrations/#standard-tests) we will use later. 
We recommended pinning these to the latest version: <img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/langchain-tests" style={{position:"relative",top:4,left:3}} />

Note: Replace `<latest_version>` with the latest version of `langchain-tests` below.

```bash
poetry add --group test pytest pytest-socket pytest-asyncio langchain-tests==<latest_version>
```

And finally, have poetry set up a virtual environment with your dependencies, as well
as your integration package:

```bash
poetry install --with test
```

You're now ready to start writing your integration package!

See our [component-specific guides](#component-specific-guides) for detail on implementing and testing each component.

## Push your package to a public Github repository

This is only required if you want to publish your integration in the LangChain documentation.

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Push your code to the repository.
3. Confirm that your repository is viewable by the public (e.g. in a private browsing window, where you're not logged into Github).

## Next Steps

Now that you've bootstrapped your package, you can move on to [implementing and testing](/docs/contributing/how_to/integrations/#component-specific-guides) your integration.
